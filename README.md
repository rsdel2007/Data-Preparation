# Data-Preparation

- I have collected some differently coloured cones by scraping google images. I have uploaded data on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_ed600Afl_Lwy0XrHsjv9FKV95B0Mx_m?usp=sharing). Some images were repeated, and some were useless, i.e., I had to filter the images manually. Finally, there are about ~1100 images. For now, I have resized the image size into 224 x 224, but I will be resizing later while training the model as per the algorithm's requirements ([models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)).
- The next part was to annotate all the images. For this, I had to create bounding boxes for each image in the data manually. I used [labelimg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) for this task. After each step, I got a ```.xml``` file for each image that contains labels and coordinates of the bounding box in Pascal-VOC format(Since I will be using SSD/Faster RCNN).
- I used ```xml_to_csv.py``` to convert the labels into ```CSV``` format. Now labels are ready to use.
- Further, I will be generating ```tfrecords``` and the ```label map```, which will complete the dataset preparation.
